The aim of our work is to implement from scratch and analyze the performance of the generalized variable projection method (GVPM) in the task of support vector machines (SVM) training. 
We implemnted both the support vector classification and regression algorithms.
We analyze the paired performance of our model and our GVPM solver with different classification and regression tasks.
